LICENCE
=======

We do not have agreed on a specific source yet.
As you see, the sources are open - means you can
read them as long and deeply as you want.

BUT: this does not mean you can do whatevery you
want with the files you find in this project.

Sources in "external" are having custom licences,
pay attention to them.
Assets from 3rd parties are CC-licenced (check the
text file in the corresponding directory).

Our sources and assets are still proprietary. So
if you intend to use the source: ask me (GWRon)
first.

If you want to contribute: do so but your code is
then useable by us without further restrictions (to
avoid running into licence limitations).
